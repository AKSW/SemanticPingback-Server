README

To setup the Semantic Pingback server follow these steps:

1. Place the contents of this folder into your Web application directory on 
   your Web server.

2. Copy the distributed configuration file (config.inc.dist.php) to
   config.inc.php. Open the file in a text editor and adjust the settings
   to fit your configuration. At least a valid database connection needs
   to be supplied. If you want to use the mail feature, make sure that
   your PHP environment is configured to send emails.

3. Prepare the configured database: You need to import the schema.sql file

4. Congratulations! Your Semantic Pingback is ready to receive Pingbacks now.
   You should now start propagationg the URL of the service. If you place the
   files in a directory like <Web-Root>/pingback/ and consequently the 
   index.php file is situated in <Web-Root/pingback/index.php, your server is
   available through the URL http://example.org/pingback/ (where example.org
   needs to be replaced with your domain).

If you want to run the Semantic Pingback Server in a docker container:

1. cd docker; docker build -t semanticpingback .

2. cd ..; docker run -it --rm --name pingback -p 8080:80 pingback

or similar
